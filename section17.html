                                This piece of code is a simple static webpage design that showcases a page called "山羊の前端小窝"
                                (Goat's Frontend Nest). In this 800-word summary, I will provide an overview of the code.
    
                                The code begins with the HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration, ensuring that the browser correctly
                                parses and displays the webpage content. It then defines the structure of the HTML document,
                                including the
    
                                head and
    
                                body tags. The
    
                                head tag is used to specify metadata information about the webpage, while the
    
                                body tag contains the actual page content.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <img src="./pic/pic16.jpeg" alt="">
                        <div class="section17_multicol">
                            <p>Within the
    
                                head tag, the
                                meta tag is used to set the character set and viewport size. The character set is set
                                to UTF-8 to ensure that the webpage can support multiple languages and character
                                encodings. The viewport size is set to match the device width, achieving a responsive
                                design that adapts and displays well on different devices.
    
                                Next is the title tag, which sets the webpage title as "山羊の前端小窝" (Goat's Frontend
                                Nest). The title will be displayed in the browser's tab, providing a brief
                                description of the page.
    
                                In the style
                                tag of the code,
                                some CSS styles are defined to control the appearance and layout of the webpage. The global
                                elements' padding and margin are set to zero to eliminate unnecessary spacing. By setting
                                the height of the body element to 2000 pixels and hiding the horizontal scrollbar, vertical
                                scrolling of the page content is achieved.
    
                                The class selector is used to select elements with the class "shell" and set them as a flex
                                layout,
                                stacking the elements vertically. The header element has a width of 100% and a height of 700
                                pixels,
                                with an irregular shape achieved through clip-path,
                                adding visual appeal to the page. The elements with the class "img" are set to relative
                                positioning,
                                filled with a background image,
                                and the background size is set to cover,
                                making the background image adapt to the element's size. The elements with the class "main"
                                are vertically aligned, and the styles of the title and text are set to enhance their
                                appearance.</p>
                        </div><img src="./pic/pic10.jpeg" alt="">
                        <div class="section17_multicol">
                            <p>Inside the
                                script tag at the end of the body tag, JavaScript code is embedded.This code uses query
                                selectors to retrieve elements from the page and implements scroll interaction effects using
                                variables and event listeners.
    
                                When a scroll event occurs, the display effects of the header and image are changed by
                                calculating the scroll distance.By setting clip - path and transform scale, the dynamic
                                changes in the shape of the header and the size of the image are achieved.As a result, when
                                users scroll the page, animation effects are triggered, adding dynamism to the page.
    
                                In conclusion, this code showcases a simple static webpage design.By combining HTML, CSS,
                                and JavaScript, it achieves the layout of page elements and scroll interaction effects.From
                                the overall structure of the page to specific style settings and animation implementation,
                                each part is carefully designed to provide users with a pleasant browsing experience.The
                                page appears clean and visually appealing, and the addition of dynamic effects enhances its
                                vitality and attractiveness, capturing users' attention and conveying the intended message
                                of the designer.</p>
